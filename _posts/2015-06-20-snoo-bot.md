## The concept

You want to share an awsome super-duper subreddit you just found, with your friends on slack but you don't quite like the basic link informations? We have a slack bot for you!

Each time you post something like r/cpp, the bot will instantly respond with the informations about the sub. Including description, subscribers, and a direct link.

It will also warn you whether the subreddit is safe for work or not.

He can also check the validity of a sub!
