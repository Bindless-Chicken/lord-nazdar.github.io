## About

Howdy. I'm Thomas, engineer with a passion for graphics. I'm currently busy working at IncubedIT making robots drive straight, in the delightful city of Graz, Austria. Before helping robots take over the workd, I worked at [ARM Ltd.](https://www.arm.com/), making graphical demos for [Mali GPU](http://malideveloper.arm.com/). I studied Engineering in Computer Graphics and Vision. My main professional areas of interest are in GPU processing, Global Illumination Lightning, and shadows.

Outisde of work, my days are shared between my passion for graphics, music, electronics, analog photography, and watchmaking. You can find some of my best photos on [500px](https://500px.com/thomaspoulet). I am a musician with classical training in Oboe and English Horn, six years as solist in an [orchestra](http://www.odhy.fr/).

During my school years, I took part in many associative projects, being president of the school's aerospace association and vice president of the student peer helping association.
