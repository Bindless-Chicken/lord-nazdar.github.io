## About

Howdy. I'm [Thomas](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/LordNazdar),software engineer in computer graphics. I'm currently working at [ARM Ltd.](https://www.arm.com/), busy making demos for [Mali GPU](http://malideveloper.arm.com/). I studied Engineering in Computer Graphics and Vision. My main areas of interest are in GPU processing and Global Illumination Lightning.

I took part in many associative projects, being president of the school's [aerospace association](http://aero.assos.efrei.fr/)" and vice president of the [student peer helping association](http://entraide.assos.efrei.fr/).

I'm also a musician with strong background in Oboe and English Horn, with six years as solist in an [orchestra](http://www.odhy.fr/). I'm interested in the Romantic and Modern Russian Music School.
